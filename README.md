# MetaMap-src
Prolog and C sources for MetaMap Named Entity Recognizer

MetaMap is a highly configurable program developed by Dr. Alan (Lan) Aronson at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to map biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus or, equivalently, to discover Metathesaurus concepts referred to in text. MetaMap uses a knowledge-intensive approach based on symbolic, natural-language processing (NLP) and computational-linguistic techniques. Besides being applied for both IR and data-mining applications, MetaMap is one of the foundations of NLM's Medical Text Indexer (MTI) which is being used for both semiautomatic and fully automatic indexing of biomedical literature at NLM.
